# Calendar - Laborat√≥rio Hacker de Campinas

Configuration files of [https://eventos.lhc.net.br](https://eventos.lhc.net.br) - the
public calendar of all events and activities of LHC. It uses [Gancio](https://gancio.org/)
and it is accessible to any person that wants to schedule some activity or event in the
hackerspace.

If you want to use it in your own organization, you can use this repository and
[this blog post](https://rennerocha.com/posts/configuring-self-hosted-calendar-for-small-community/)
as reference. Also, you can keep in touch with LHC members to get more info how to manage it.

You need to install [flyctl](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/install/) CLI to be able to execute any
of the tasks described below.

## Deployment

The application is running in a [fly.io](https://fly.io/) account. If you are planning to upgrade it,
ask some member of LHC board to get access credentials.

### Authentication

Before start using [fly.io](https://fly.io/), you need to authenticate with the right credentials. Use
the command bellow and follow the instructions:

```
$ flyctl auth login
```

### Production Deploy

When everything is configured as desired, deploy to production using the command:

```
flyctl deploy --verbose
```

### Status

This command will show the status of the application:

```
flyctl status
```

This command will show the logs of the application:

```
flyctl logs
```

This command will open a console in your application server:

```
fly ssh console -C bash
```

## Data Backup

We use SQLite as database because this is not a website that will have a
significant traffic, so keeping all the data in the filesystem is enough.

[Volumes](https://fly.io/docs/reference/volumes/) are used to store
the database, uploaded files and logs. fly.io performs [regular snapshots](https://fly.io/docs/flyctl/volumes-snapshots/) 
that can be used as one source of backups. However, if we want to download the content of the volume to our local 
computer we need to execute the following steps:

- A SSH token is needed so we can perform the backup without the need of the visual authentication:

```
fly tokens create ssh
```

The output of this command will start with the string `FlyV1` followed by a token. Save this token and don't share it
publicily. **ANYONE WITH THIS TOKEN WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE FULL ACCESS TO THE APPLICATION!**

```
FlyV1 fm2_lJP[..........]9d2g=
```

- Create an environment variable with the content of the token:

```
export FLY_SSH_TOKEN=<TOKEN_VALUE>
```

- Execute the backup script:

```
./local_backup.sh
```

This script will create a tarball with the uploaded media assets (under `/data`) and the database files, and store
it locally in a filename with the pattern `"gancio_data_%DATE_IN_ISO_FORMAT%.tar.gz"`.

## Upgrading Gancio

Watch [gancio.org](https://gancio.org/changelog) page to know when a new version is available. Before
upgrading it, create a local backup of `/data/` directory in your local machine following the instructions
of the previous section.

The [Dockerfile](https://github.com/lhc/eventos.lhc.net.br/blob/main/Dockerfile#L7) used, gets the latest version
of Gancio, so you just need to redeploy the application in [fly.io](https://fly.io/) and we should have the
new version applied correctly.

If you want to redeploy a specific version (e.g. to revert the upgrade), change the content of the
[Dockerfile](https://github.com/lhc/eventos.lhc.net.br/blob/main/Dockerfile#L7) to fetch the desired
version.
